* stock splits

* annualised returns
  [now done in status command] ]

* clean up code

* more error checking on calls to DBI et al

* read more info from the rc file ~/.beancounterrc such as host, 
  port, user, ... 
  [ partly done ]

* allow "restrictions" on beancounter operations, eg do a portfolio update at
  13:00 EST with the restriction of doing it only for shares with currencies
  that are GBP or EUR (or SEK or DKK ...) to get the European market
  [ done, also added 'extrafx' argument ]

* there is buglet that rears its head when a stock is added to portfolio 
  during business hours as its current price is also added for that day ...
  which creates a conflict when that stock is later updated during the normal
  update. This is difficult to circumvent as we don't want to reinvent
  cron within beancounter. Either we do update for the current day (as we do
  now, which has the problem) or don't (in which case we might never get that
  datum if we updated after the daily cron run)
