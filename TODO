* stock splits

* annualised returns
  [was done in status command, currently turned off; probably needs another
   switch to allow a date after which we annualise, say a year]

* clean up code

* more error checking on calls to DBI et al

* read more info from the rc file ~/.beancounterrc such as host, 
  port, user, ... 
  [ partly done ]

* allow "restrictions" on beancounter operations, eg do a portfolio update at
  13:00 EST with the restriction of doing it only for shares with currencies
  that are GBP or EUR (or SEK or DKK ...) to get the European market
  [ done in 0.2.0, also added 'extrafx' argument ]

* there is buglet that rears its head when a stock is added to portfolio 
  during business hours as its current price is also added for that day ...
  which creates a conflict when that stock is later updated during the normal
  update. This is difficult to circumvent as we don't want to reinvent
  cron within beancounter. Either we do update for the current day (as we do
  now, which has the problem) or don't (in which case we might never get that
  datum if we updated after the daily cron run)

* fx quotes are currently retrieved via Yahoo from the Philadelphia exchange
  -- but that means no quotes are available on US holidays. We also have no
  access to historical FX data

* Yahoo seems to return bad date information every now and then. A
  "scrubbing" between retrieval and databasing might help: we can check if
  other data points for the same exchange have a different date and then use
  this as an override. Might be overkill.
  [ partly done; now have --forcedate option ]

* Allow for cash holdings
  [ partly done ]

* Options (.X) volume adjustment
