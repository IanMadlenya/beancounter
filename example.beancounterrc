#  The format of this file is simple:  pairs of  key=value where
#  the key must be a symbol used and recognised by the global hash
#  %Config; some command-line arguments are also recognized.  See 
#  the GetConfig() function in BeanCounter.pm for the gory details.
 
#  Set the host on which the beancounter db is stored 
host=localhost

#  Set the database user -- Note that you if don't specify
#  a user, your (system) uid is used via the USER variable
#user=joe

#  Set the database password -- not needed if e.g. the database 
#  grants eg access locally. Hence defaults to 'undef'.
#password=joesecret

#  Declare that we want to connect using ODBC rather than via
#  the Perl DBD driver for Postgres. See beancounter(1) for an
#  example ODBC configuration file, and the libiodbc documentation.
#  Default is 0, i.e. DBD-PG.
#odbc=1

#  Set the default domestic currency. Default is USD  (yes, I moved :)
#currency=CAD

#  Example of setting a firewall proxy host, and user:password
#proxy=1.2.3.4:80
#firewall=joeuser:joepasswd
