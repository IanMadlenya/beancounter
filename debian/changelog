beancounter (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release with the following new features

    - Support for MySQL has been added: beancounter can now work with both
      PostgreSQL and MySQL, including all steps up from the database creation

    - The update command's SQL query has been rewritten so that all stocks
      known to beancounter are updated, yet still allows the use of the
      --restriction option to specify only subsets of the portfolio

    - The update command is now idempotent: it can now be run several
      times during a trading day; the initial data set will be 'insert'ed,
      following ones 'update'd (this comes at the cost of an additional query)

    - Better support of old, expired or delisted stocks: unparseable
      dates, as well as dates that "too old" (where the current default 5
      business days) are set to N/A; and dates which test for N/A are neither
      scrubbed nor databased during the "update" command.
  
    - Database backend and database name can now be set as parameters which
      facilitates multiple databases and backends to be used in parallel
  
    - New (boolean) option --fxupdate which defauls to 'true', hence the
      use of --nofxupdate prevents any updates to the FX database

    - Database scheme change in stockprices table: column names changed to
      day_open, day_close, day_change for consistency (and MySQL gripes).
      Similarly, index becomes stockindex in the indices table. Hence, 
      users /upgrading from an older version/ must run update_beancounter.
  
  * Detailed changes:

    - [BeanCounter.pm] --verbose and --debug now passed to DBI connection
      for Warn and PrintError, respectively 

    - [BeanCounter.pm] New configuration options dbsystem and dbname,
      defaulting to PostgreSQL and beancounter

    - [BeanCounter.pm] Protect name with dbh->quote for DatabaseInfoData

    - [BeanCounter.pm] Several small code cleanups and documentation updates
  
    - [beancounter] New command-line options --dbsystem and --dbname
  
    - [beancounter] Several updates and extensions to the pod documentation

    - [setup_beancounter] Now with command-line options -m, -s dbname, -s

    - [setup_beancounter] Parallel code for MySQL db creations added

    - [setup_beancounter] Added manual page as POD document within

    - [update_beancounter] Added code for the database table transition

    - [update_beancounter] Added manual page as POD document within

beancounter (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release with the following code changes

    - new command "risk" for report with value-at-risk at (VaR) percentile
      estimates, using both the standard (parametric) approach as well as
      a nonparametric quantile estimate
      "risk" also computes marginal value-at-risk (slow for large portfolios)
      "risk" requires the Statistics::Descriptive modules

    - new option "--forceupdate <date>" to permit overriding of a faulty
      date supplied by Yahoo! Finance (which is becoming more common)

    - new command "allreports" for dayend, status and risk reports all in once

    - added status and risk reports to jobs ran by "dailyjob" command

    - new ScrubDailyData routine; currently only using the "--forceupdate
      date" check on the pricing date supplied by Yahoo!

    - prevdate defaults to "six months ago" (better default for risk report)

    - "status" also shows cash holding from table `cash' (preliminary feature)

    - improved internal logic for argument and option checking + db connection

    - improved report calculations, report display and documentation

    - documentation corrected (command is 'delete', not 'deletestock')
