beancounter (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New release with the following code changes
    - new command "risk" for report with value-at-risk at (VaR) percentile
      estimates, using both the standard (parametric) approach as well as
      a nonparametric quantile estimate
      "risk" also computes marginal value-at-risk (slow for large portfolios)
      "risk" requires the Statistics::Descriptive modules
    - new option "--forceupdate <date>" to permit overriding of a faulty
      date supplied by Yahoo! Finance (which is becoming more common)
    - new command "allreports" for dayend, status and risk reports all in once
    - added status and risk reports to jobs ran by "dailyjob" command
    - new ScrubDailyData routine; currently only using the "--forceupdate
      date" check on the pricing date supplied by Yahoo!
    - prevdate defaults to "six months ago" (better default for risk report)
    - "status" also shows cash holding from table `cash' (preliminary feature)
    - improved internal logic for argument and option checking + db connection
    - improved report calculations, report display and documentation
    - documentation corrected (command is 'delete', not 'deletestock')
